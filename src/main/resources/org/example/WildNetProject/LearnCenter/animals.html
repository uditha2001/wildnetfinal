            <p>
                Animals constitute a broad kingdom of complex, multicellular organisms known scientifically as Animalia. These organisms are characterized primarily by their ability to move voluntarily, consume organic material for energy, and possess specialized sensory organs for interaction with their environment. Unlike plants, animals lack cell walls and typically have nervous, muscular, and digestive systems. With over a million described species, animals represent a diverse group ranging from microscopic creatures like zooplankton to large mammals such as elephants and whales.

            Key Characteristics

           <ol>
            <li>1.	Mobility: Unlike most other organisms, animals can move spontaneously and independently at some point in their life cycle.</li>
             <li>2.	Heterotrophy: They rely on consuming other organisms for sustenance, differing from autotrophs like plants, which produce their own food through photosynthesis.</li>
            <li>3.	Cell Structure: Animal cells are eukaryotic and lack rigid cell walls, which contributes to their flexibility and mobility.</li>
           </ol>
            Classification
            Animals are classified into various phyla based on their body plan, type of symmetry, and developmental stages. The major phyla include:
           <ol>
            <li>•	Chordata: Animals with a dorsal nerve cord, which includes all vertebrates like fishes, birds, mammals, amphibians, and reptiles.</li>
             <li>•	Arthropoda: The largest phylum which includes insects, arachnids, myriapods, and crustaceans. These animals are characterized by their jointed limbs and chitinous exoskeleton</li>
            <li>•	Mollusca: This group includes snails, bivalves, cephalopods, and other mollusks, which are largely known for their soft bodies and hard shells.</li>
           </ol>

            Habitat and Adaptations
            <p>
                Animals inhabit every ecosystem on the planet, from the deepest oceans to the highest mountains, adapting to a wide range of environmental conditions. This adaptability has enabled various species to thrive in diverse habitats, each evolving unique mechanisms to survive and reproduce
            </p>
            
            Role in Ecosystems

            <p>
                Animals play crucial roles in maintaining the balance of ecosystems. They serve as predators, prey, decomposers, and pollinators, among other roles. For example, predators help manage the population of other species, preventing any single species from overwhelming an ecosystem. Similarly, bees and other insects pollinate plants, which is essential for the production of fruits and seeds.   
                  
            </p>
            Conservation Issues
            <p>
                Many animal species are threatened by human activities such as habitat destruction, pollution, hunting, and climate change. Conservation efforts worldwide aim to protect endangered species and their habitats through various strategies including legal protection, wildlife reserves, and breeding programs.
